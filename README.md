## [Full Stack Open 2022](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

In this repository I will be recording my progress completing UH's Full Stack Open 2022 course. This course is held at the University of Helsinki Depratment of Computer Science.

The course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

It also covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.
